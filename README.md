VKStats
=======
The issue for VK.COM competition. The site events tracking system.

<b>The site part</b>:<br>
1. A library for events tracking on a site (pure JavaScript).<br>
2. Test site with included library and example code for buttons clicks tracking (Angular). 

<b>The admin part</b>:<br>
1. Backend that take a data about events needed to capture, occured events and prepare statistic data about it (PHP, MySQL).<br>
2. Admin interface to manage projects, events needed to capture and see statistic about occured events in tables and charts (jQuery, Angular, Highcharts JS, Twitter Bootstrap).
